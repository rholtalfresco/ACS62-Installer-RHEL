Alfresco End User Agreement
PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE PURCHASING AND/OR USING SOFTWARE OR SUPPORT FROM
ALFRESCO. BY USING ALFRESCO SOFTWARE OR SUPPORT, USER ACCEPTS THIS AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGES IT
HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS THIS AGREEMENT. AN INDIVIDUAL ACTING ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY REPRESENTS THAT
HE OR SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY. IF USER DOES NOT
ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN IT MUST NOT USE ALFRESCO SOFTWARE OR SUPPORT.
This Alfresco End User License Agreement (the "Agreement") is between Alfresco Software, Ltd., a United Kingdom limited company
(“Alfresco”), and the individual or entity that accepts the terms of this Agreement ("User"). The effective date of this Agreement
(“Effective Date”) is the earlier of the date that User formally accepts this Agreement or first uses Alfresco’s Software or Support. 
1. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT
1.1 Software and Support. This Agreement governs User’s
use of Alfresco Software and, if applicable, Support. “Support”
means Alfresco maintenance and support. "Software" means
the software accompanying this Agreement and branded by
Alfresco; provided, Software does not include third-party opensource software that may be provided therewith or Community
Versions. “Community Versions” means the free, open-source
community versions that Alfresco makes available at no charge,
including without limitation Digital Business Platform, Alfresco
Content Services, Alfresco Process Services and Records
Management software. “Order Form” means the ordering
documents placed by User. "Subscription" means access to the
Software and, where applicable, Support for a defined period of
time (the “Subscription Period”), as set forth in an Order Form.
1.2. Business Partners. User is purchasing Software and
Support from an Alfresco business partner (a "Business
Partner"). Alfresco will provide the purchased Software and
Support to User under the terms of this Agreement, but is not
responsible for (a) the actions of Business Partners, (b) any
additional obligations Business Partners may have to User, or (c)
any non-Alfresco products or services that Business Partners
supply to User.
2. REPORTING AND RECORDS
2.1 Reporting. User will notify Alfresco or the Business
Partner promptly if User exceeds the number of Cores and/or
authorized Named Users purchased under the applicable Order
Form. In its notice, User will include the number of excess Cores
and/or Named Users, and the date(s) on which the additional
Cores were first used and/or the date User exceeded its licensed
Named Users. Alfresco (or the Business Partner) will invoice
User for the applicable fees and User will promptly pay such
fees.
2.2 Records Retention. User will maintain accurate records
necessary to verify the number of Cores it uses and Named
Users it authorizes. Upon Alfresco's written request, User will
provide Alfresco such records within ten (10) business days.
3. LICENSE AND OWNERSHIP
3.1 Grant to User. Subject to User's compliance with this
Agreement, Alfresco grants to User, during the Subscription
Period: (a) a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable
license to use, copy, test, and modify the Software solely for
User's own internal use and limited to the number of Cores,
Named Users, and/or Active Processes designated in the Order
Form, as applicable; (b) the rights in the third party open-source
software provided with the Software, which rights are set forth in
the applicable third-party licenses; (c) for the term designated in 
an Order Form, the right to receive Support; and (d) a license to
use the Software on the number of Cores designated in the
Order Form for backup and disaster-recovery testing purposes.
“Cores” means physical computer processing cores or virtual
Central Processing Units (vCPUs), sold by Alfresco in groups of
four Cores. As licensed by Alfresco, an initial set of four Cores
allows User to deploy the Software on up to four physical
cores, or up to four vCPUs, on a single server instance. If User
purchases eight or more Cores, User may deploy the Software
on physical cores or vCPUs equal to the number of Cores it has
purchased, without limitation as to the number of server
instances upon which they can run. For example, if User
purchases Alfresco Content Services (with eight Cores), User
may deploy the Software on up to eight physical cores, or up to
eight vCPUs, on any number of server instances. “Named User”
means an individual who has been given a unique user name or
identifier to access the Software, and who has accessed the
Software at least one time. No more than one individual may use
an issued user name or identifier, and the sharing of such
credentials is expressly prohibited. “Active Process,” as used
with purchases of Alfresco Process Services software, means a
process instance within the Software that has not been
completed, cancelled, or formally suspended. Processes that
have been initiated—but which have not been completed,
cancelled, or formally suspended, or which are in a “wait” state—
shall constitute Active Processes regardless of the level of user
or machine activity associated with those processes over time.
3.2 Restrictions. User will not, directly or indirectly: (a)
sublicense, resell, rent, lease, distribute, market, commercialize
or otherwise transfer rights or usage to: (i) the Software, (ii) any
modified version or derivative work of the Software created by
the User or for the User, or (iii) Community Versions; (b) remove
or alter any copyright, trademark or proprietary notice in the
Software; (c) transfer, use or export the Software in violation of
any laws or regulations of any government; (d) combine, call, link
to, or otherwise use the Software in conjunction with any
Community Version, or use any Support for Community Versions
or for unlicensed Cores or Named Users; or (e) reverse engineer,
decompile or modify any encrypted or encoded portion of the
Software.
3.3 Proprietary Rights. Alfresco and its licensors will own all
right, title, and interest to the Software, Support, technology,
information, code or software provided to User by Alfresco,
including all copies or modifications made by Alfresco.
3.4 ACS Specific Restriction Only. If User makes a new
purchase of Alfresco Content Services (ACS) on or after
September 1, 2017, the following restriction shall apply:
The Alfresco Content Services (ACS) includes a workflow
capability along with a predetermined set of document-review
and approval workflows, and a set of predetermined 
management-task functions. User may use and modify the
predetermined workflows and management tasks that are
provided with the ACS subscription. However, User may not use
the workflow software to design, create or run other types of
workflows, business processes and/or management tasks. A
separate subscription for Alfresco Process Services (APS)
software is required for any such uses.
4. TERM AND TERMINATION
4.1 Term and Termination of Agreement. This Agreement
will remain in effect for the duration of any active Subscription
Period. Upon termination of User’s Subscription Period, User’s
use of the Software will be limited to read-only access.
If User materially breaches the terms of this Agreement, and the
breach is not cured (or curable) within thirty (30) days after
written notice of the breach, then Alfresco may, upon written
notice, to the breaching party, terminate this Agreement and
User’s access to the Software and Support.
4.2 Survival. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason,
Sections 3.2, 3.3, 4.2, 5, 6.2, 7, 8 and 9 of this Agreement will
survive termination.
5. CONFIDENTIALITY
5.1 Confidential Information.
(a) Definition. In connection with this Agreement, either
party (the “Recipient”) may obtain confidential and proprietary
information (“Confidential Information”) from the other (the
“Discloser”). Confidential Information may include, without
limitation, information about systems designs, pricing, cost data,
financial information, business, sales, and marketing plans,
products, product roadmaps, service programs, trade secrets,
know-how, inventions, techniques, processes, programs,
schematics, software, and data. Confidential Information
includes information designated in writing as confidential, and
any information a reasonable person would understand to be
confidential or proprietary under the circumstances of its
disclosure.
(b) Exclusions. “Confidential Information” does not include
information that: (i) has been independently developed by or for
the Recipient without access or reference to, or use of,
Confidential Information; (ii) is lawfully received free of restriction
from another source having the right to furnish such information;
(iii) is or becomes lawfully in the public domain other than
through a breach of this Agreement; (iv) was lawfully known by
the Recipient prior to disclosure; (v) Discloser agrees in writing is
free of such restrictions; or (vi) is generally disclosed by the
Discloser to third parties without a duty of confidentiality.
(c) Duties With Respect To Confidential Information. At all
times during and after the term of this Agreement, Recipient shall
keep Discloser’s Confidential Information confidential using the
same degree of care that it uses to protect its own Confidential
Information, but not less than a reasonable degree of care, and
shall not disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to a third
party without the Discloser’s written consent, or use the
Confidential Information for purposes other than the performance
of this Agreement. Where disclosure is required by law, such
disclosure shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement
provided Recipient gives Discloser reasonable advance notice to 
enable Discloser to seek appropriate protection of the
Confidential Information.
6. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
6.1 General Representations and Warranties. Alfresco
represents and warrants that: (a) it will use reasonable skill and
care in providing contracted Support; (b) the Support will be
performed in a professional and workmanlike manner by qualified
personnel; (c) it has the authority to enter into this Agreement
with User; and (d) Alfresco has taken commercially reasonable
measures to ensure the Software does not, at the time of delivery
to User, include malicious mechanisms or code designed to
damage or corrupt the Software.
6.2 Disclaimer of Warranty. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
PROVIDED IN SECTION 6.1, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE AND
SUPPORT PROVIDED BY ALFRESCO ARE PROVIDED
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. ALFRESCO DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE
USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR SUPPORT WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE, OR THAT ALFRESCO WILL
CORRECT ALL SOFTWARE ERRORS. FOR THE BREACH OF
THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 6.1, USER’S
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND ALFRESCO’S ENTIRE LIABILITY
WILL BE TO UNDERTAKE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE
EFFORTS TO REMEDY THE SUPPORT DEFICIENCY,
SUPPLY A TEMPORARY FIX, OR MAKE AN EMERGENCY
BYPASS. IF ALFRESCO CANNOT SUBSTANTIALLY
CORRECT A BREACH IN A COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE
MANNER, USER MAY TERMINATE THE RELEVANT
SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION AND RECEIVE A PRO RATA
REFUND OF FEES PAID FOR THE REMAINING
SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF
THE TERMINATION.
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMER OF
DAMAGES
7.1 Disclaimer of Damages. NOTWITHSTANDING
ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT OR AN
ORDER FORM, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY OR ITS
AFFILIATES BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ITS
AFFILIATES FOR DAMAGES OTHER THAN DIRECT
DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION: ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER IN TORT,
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE;
OR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
WITH ANY MALFUNCTIONS, REGULATORY NONCOMPLIANCE, DELAYS, LOSS OF DATA, LOST PROFITS,
LOST SAVINGS, INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE, LOSS OF
BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATORY PROFITS, EVEN A PARTY OR
ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. LIABILITY FOR THESE DAMAGES
WILL BE LIMITED AND EXCLUDED EVEN IF ANY EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT FAILS OF
ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
7.2 Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY’S (OR ITS
AFFILIATES’) AGGREGATE AND CUMULATIVE LIABILITY 
ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE OR OTHERWISE
WILL EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR OWED TO
ALFRESCO BY USER, EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH A
BUSINESS PARTNER, DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS
IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE FIRST EVENT GIVING RISE
TO LIABILITY. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT IS INTENDED
TO EXCLUDE OR LIMIT EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR
DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR PROPERTY DAMAGE
CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, OR FOR FRAUD. NOTHING IN
THIS SECTION WILL LIMIT THE FEES OWED BY USER
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR SOFTWARE OR SUPPORT,
OR FOR EXCEEDING THE SCOPE OF THE LICENSES
GRANTED OR VIOLATING THE RESTRICTIONS IN SECTION
3.
8. INDEMNIFICATION
8.1 Defense. If a third party initiates or threatens a legal
action alleging that User’s use of the Software directly infringes
the third party’s patent, copyright, trademark or misappropriates
the third party’s trade secret rights (“Third Party Rights”) (such
action, a “Claim”), then Alfresco will (a) promptly assume the
defense of the Claim and (b) pay costs, damages and/or
reasonable attorneys’ fees that are included in a final judgment
against User (without right of appeal) or in a settlement approved
by Alfresco that are attributable to User’s use of the Software;
provided that User (i) is current in the payment of all applicable
fees, or becomes current, prior to requesting indemnification, (ii)
notifies Alfresco in writing of the Claim promptly after receipt of
the Claim, (iii) provides Alfresco the right to control the defense of
the Claim with counsel of its choice, and to settle such Claim at
Alfresco’s sole discretion (unless the settlement requires
payment by User or requires User to admit liability), and (iv)
reasonably cooperates with Alfresco in the defense of the Claim.
8.2 Injunctive Relief. If the Software becomes the subject of
any actual or anticipated third party infringement claim, Alfresco
may, at its sole option and expense, (i) procure for User the right
to continue using the affected Software consistent with this
Agreement, (ii) replace or modify the affected Software with
functionally equivalent software that does not infringe, or, if either
(i) or (ii) is not available on a basis that Alfresco finds
commercially feasible, (iii) terminate the Agreement or applicable
Order Form and refund any prepaid fees for all unused portions
of the Subscription Period.
8.3 Exclusions. Alfresco will have no liability for any Claim
based upon (a) use of non-current versions of the Software when
Alfresco has made newer, non-infringing versions available to the
User; (b) altered versions of the Software (unless the specific
alteration was made by or for Alfresco); (c) use, operation or
combination of the applicable Software with non-Alfresco
programs, data, equipment or documentation if such infringement
would have been avoided but for such use, operation or
combination; (d) Alfresco’s compliance with designs,
specifications or instructions provided by User where those
designs, specifications or instructions cause the infringement; (e)
use by User after notice by Alfresco to discontinue use of all or a
portion of the Software; or (f) third- party open-source software.
This section constitutes the entire liability of Alfresco, and User’s
sole and exclusive remedy, with respect to any third party claims
of infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights.
9. GENERAL
9.1 Notices. Notices under this Agreement must be in writing
and delivered: (a) if to Alfresco, to its Chief Financial Officer, with
a copy to its General Counsel; (b) if to User, to its Chief Financial
Officer or any individual identified in the Order Form. Notices will
be deemed received when (1) delivered personally; or (2) upon
confirmed delivery by a commercial express carrier.
9.2 Compliance with Applicable Laws. Each party will
comply with all applicable laws, including applicable export
control restrictions. In order for Alfresco to provide Support to
User, it may be necessary for Alfresco to share information with
its Affiliates, Business Partners, and/or subcontractors, which
may be located worldwide. In such event, Alfresco will comply
with Section 5 of this Agreement and with applicable data privacy
laws governing the transfer of that information.
9.3 Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in a
signed agreement between the parties, this Agreement
constitutes the exclusive and complete agreement between
Alfresco and User with respect to User’s use of Alfresco Software
and/or Support, and supersedes all prior oral or written
discussions, agreements or understandings.
9.4 Force Majeure. Force majeure events shall excuse the
affected party (the "Non-Performing Party") from its obligations
under this Agreement so long as the event and its effects
continue. Force majeure events include, without limitation, Acts
of God, natural disasters, war, riot, network attacks, acts of
terrorism, fire, explosion, accident, sabotage, strikes, inability to
obtain power, fuel, material or labor, or acts of any government.
As soon as feasible, the Non-Performing Party shall notify the
other party of (a) its best reasonable assessment of the nature
and duration of the force majeure event, and (b) the steps it is
taking to mitigate its effects. If the force majeure event prevents
performance for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, and the
parties have not agreed upon a revised basis for performance,
then either party may immediately terminate the Agreement upon
written notice.
9.5 Severability/Waiver. If any provision of this Agreement is
ruled invalid or unenforceable, the provision shall be severable
from this Agreement so that the remaining provisions are
unaffected. No waiver of any rights under this Agreement will
constitute a subsequent waiver unless otherwise stated in writing.
9.6 Dispute Resolution. English law shall govern all aspects
of this Agreement. Any dispute arising from this Agreement shall
be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts located in
England and Wales, without regard to their conflict-of-law
principles or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods.
9.7 Headings. All headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for identification and convenience and will not be
deemed part of this Agreement for purposes of interpretation.
9.8 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or
modified except in a writing signed by the parties, with specific
reference to this Agreement.
THE FOLLOWING APPLIES ONLY IF USER HAS PURCHASED DIRECT ALFRESCO SUPPORT
Attachment 1
(Alfresco Support)
1. Alfresco Support Programs. Alfresco’s support offerings, service levels, and guidelines are set forth at
http://www.alfresco.com/support/guidelines. If User has purchased support, User’s applicable support program(s) will be set forth in
the Order Form.
Alfresco support may be used only for User’s internal purposes. Use of Alfresco support on behalf of a third party that is not a
party to the Agreement, or for Community Versions, is a material breach of the Agreement.
2.1 Scope of Support. In using Alfresco support, User agrees it will: (a) provide Alfresco with sufficient information and resources
to correct the applicable support issue; (b) install and operate the Software on an Alfresco-supported stack, as identified at
http://www.alfresco.com/services/support/stacks/; (c) promptly install all service packs provided by Alfresco; and (d) procure, install and
maintain all equipment, telephone lines, communication interfaces and other hardware necessary to operate the Software.
User is responsible for reading the release notes and any other available documentation before installing or upgrading the
Software, and for testing the Software before deploying it in a production environment. User should also backup its production systems
on a regular basis and have those backups available if needed for support purposes. Alfresco is not obligated to provide support for the
following: (a) Software that has been modified or damaged by User or a third party (unless at Alfresco’s direction); (b) issues caused by
User’s negligence, hardware malfunction or other causes beyond the reasonable control of Alfresco; (c) issues caused by third party
software not licensed through Alfresco or provided by Alfresco.
2.2 Technical Support Contacts. Alfresco customer support will provide Support to the designated contacts, as identified in an
Order Form (“Technical Support Contacts”). The Technical Support Contacts should have “read, write and execute” access to the
necessary files, English language communication skills and relevant technical knowledge. User may modify its designated Technical
Support Contacts at any time during the term of a Subscription by notifying Alfresco in writing and giving Alfresco five (5) business days
to process the change. Technical Support Contacts will be the only interface to the Alfresco customer support center. It is
recommended that the Technical Support Contacts obtain the applicable Software certification by attending the required Alfresco
training courses. In an emergency, an Alfresco customer support engineer will respond to an issue for an unauthorized contact on an
exception basis subject to later verification and involvement of a named Technical Support Contact.
